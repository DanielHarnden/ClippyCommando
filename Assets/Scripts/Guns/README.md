# Player Gun Scripts

## All of the scripts relating to the player's weapons and their bullets. Each script is named after their respective weapon / bullet in the format ShootXXX / XXXBullet

<br><br>

## Design philosophy:

#### Pistol intended to be average weapon; cheap ammo, but with a significant shooting cooldown and negligable clip size. Most of the game is expected to be played with the pistol.

#### Shotgun intended to a close-combat or crowd control weapon; poor accuracy limits the shotgun from replacing the pistol (considering that if pellet count is increased, the price to projectiles instantiated ratio is insanely small), but allows it to shine in situations where there are many enemies close to the player.

#### Minigun intended to be a fun weapon; expensive ammo which runs out quickly limits it to situations where the player will kill high-health enemies or shred through groups.

#### Scissors intended to be a hail mary weapon; expensive but guaranteed OHKO to potentially many enemies.
